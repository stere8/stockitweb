    <h2>Introduction to the StockIT Project</h2>
    <p>
        StockIT is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline inventory management for small to medium-sized businesses.
        This project aims to simplify the tracking, updating, and management of stock levels, providing businesses with a clear,
        real-time view of their inventory. As the lead developer on this project, my role has been to oversee the development process
        from conception to deployment, ensuring that the application meets the specific needs of our target users.
        This project is a collaborative effort, with contributions from a team of developers, designers, and business analysts
        who have worked together to bring StockIT to life.

    <h2>The Build and Make of StockIT</h2>
    <h3>Overview of the Technologies Used</h3>
    <p>
        StockIT is built using ASP.NET Core and Razor Pages, leveraging the power and flexibility of these technologies
        to create a robust and user-friendly web application. The project targets the .NET 8.0 framework, as indicated in the
        StockIT.csproj and StockIT.BLL.csproj files, ensuring that we are using the latest features and improvements offered by .NET.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>ASP.NET Core: Chosen for its high performance and ability to handle high levels of traffic, ASP.NET Core serves as the backbone of our web application.</li>
        <li>Razor Pages: Used for creating dynamic web pages that interact seamlessly with our backend logic. Razor Pages make it easier to write clean, maintainable code by keeping the HTML markup and C# processing code together.</li>
        <li>Entity Framework Core: For data access, we've utilized Entity Framework Core, which allows for a code-first approach to database development. This ORM framework simplifies data manipulation and ensures our application is scalable.</li>
    </ul>
